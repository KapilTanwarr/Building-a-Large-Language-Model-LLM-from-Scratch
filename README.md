# 🧠 Building a Large Language Model (LLM) from Scratch

A minimal, educational implementation of a Transformer-based language model, built step-by-step in PyTorch.

This project helps demystify how GPT-style models work under the hood — from token embeddings, positional encodings, transformer blocks, to final vocabulary prediction — using nothing but pure code.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Implements a simple but functional Transformer-based LLM
- Uses token embeddings + positional encoding
- Stacks multiple Transformer blocks (attention + MLP)
- Trains end-to-end on token sequences
- Predicts the next token based on context

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python
- ⚙️ PyTorch (`torch`, `nn`, `autograd`)
- 🔢 NumPy (if needed for token manipulations)
- 📚 Optionally: Hugging Face Tokenizers or your own simple tokenizer

## 📦 Key Components

| Component                | Description                                               |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `SimpleLLM`              | Main transformer-based language model                     |
| `Embedding`              | Maps token IDs to vectors                                 |
| `PositionalEncoding`     | Adds positional info to embeddings                        |
| `TransformerBlock`       | Implements self-attention + feedforward + layer norms     |
| `generate()` (optional)  | Autoregressive text generation                            |

---

## Each TransformerBlock includes:

- Multi-head Self-Attention
- Add & Norm
- Feedforward Network
- Add & Norm


## 🚀 Potential Extensions

- Add generate() method for text generation
- Add masking for causal/self-attention
- Add dropout and regularization
- Train on a real corpus using CrossEntropyLoss
- Use custom tokenizer or Hugging Face tokenizers

## 🤖 Why This Matters

- Understanding transformers and LLMs at the code level unlocks real insight into:
- How GPT models generate coherent text
- Why attention mechanisms are powerful
- How scaling layers builds depth and intelligence
